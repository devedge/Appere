Notes:

Application workflow:
1. On start, load a filler image. Take action from #2

2. (a) When an image is clicked, immediately display it, then go to #3
   (b) If an image is drag-and-dropped onto the window, immediately display it,
        then go to #3

3. Load the file list for the image's current directory in the background. When
    done, allow the next & previous images to be displayed. If the 'next' or
    'previous' images are requested while loading, defer to a loading icon until
    done.

4. For any errors, catch them and display and error image






CSS:
class for the general image. worries about centering, scaling, etc..
class for the bottom row of control elements
    class for the left controls
    class for the right controls
class to blur the entire screen for 'deletion confirmation'
class for displaying the 'more info' popup
class for the spinner?
class to fade elements in/out nicely. options to change defaults?

JS:
file to handle major app functions
file to handle filesystem stuff
file to handle user keyboard input



Design a custom CSS spinner instead of importing an entire glyphicon
library


Add code to check if the image exists at that location.
if not, check if the next/previous image can be displayed
otherwise, display a generic 'no image found'. needs to look good.

add code to check how quickly the last 'next' button was pressed
if it was really quick, don't load the image at all to keep from taxing
the CPU


Other stuff:
Maximize load time performance
    write a specific loader module to optimize loading everything else
    on startup, automatically load the html + css + loader
    after that, prepare everything else
    (consider dynamically loading other things (like the spinner) later)

installed collections.js
    use to improve things (check if it does anything to speed?)

Write an image search bar into the viewer? Would search just the current directory?
    If so, would need option to set a different shorcut


Options to save:
    Save previous window size
    Resize window to image
    Stretch images to window (disabled if previous is enabled)
    (Windows and Linux) display menubar option
    Image wraparound enabled
